# predict

The idea is to predict a geophysical well log, the sonic, using a suite of other logs: depth, density, gamma ray, and nutron.

I'll get the logs from the same well that Alessandro Amato del Monte used in the 
[Seismic Petrophysics Notebook] (https://github.com/seg/tutorials/blob/master/1506_Seismic_petrophysics_2/Seismic_petrophysics_2.ipynb) accompanying his
 [Geophysical tutorial] (http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/tle34040440.1) article on The Leading Edge.
